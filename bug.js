This error occurs when using Expo's `Image` component with a URI that is not properly formatted or accessible.  This can manifest in various ways, but frequently involves the image failing to load or showing a broken image icon.  One of the most common reasons is using a local file path directly within the `source` prop without using `require('./path/to/image.jpg')` or a correctly formatted URI if loading from a remote source.  Another less common cause is network issues or incorrect permissions if loading from the network, or if the file is not in the project's assets directory.  Finally, using an incorrect file extension can also cause this.
